# vvd, universal vdisk manager

**NOTE**: This is currently a toy project so don't expect anything from this.
It's also pretty disorganized at the moment, and __dangerous__.

**CURRENTLY NOT PRODUCTION READY**

vvd aims to be a simple tool to manage virtual disks as one stand-alone solution.

**WARNING**: This tool is still in really early development. Keep a backup of
your virtual disks because this thing might explode violently.
