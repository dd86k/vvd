.SH DESCRIPTION

vvd aims to be a simple to use universal virtual disk management tool.

.SH OPERATIONS

One of these must be used to operate with a virtual disk. all virtual disk
file references are referenced by "VDISK".

.IP -I
Get information on VDISK

Get VDISK information such as VDISK headers (type, virtual size, etc.), MBR,
EFI, and FS, if available. Supports option
.OP -r

.IP -M
Get allocation map for VDISK

Get allocation map for VDISK. If the VDISK type is not dynamic, the operation
is aborted.

.IP -N
Create new VDISK

Create a new VDISK with SIZE and optional TYPE specifications. Dynamic disks
are created by default. If
.OP -c
is specified (create as raw), the file is pre-allocated like a fixed VDISK.
.B WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANYTHING GIVEN IN PATH!
Here is an example of the format:

.EX
vvd -N FILE SIZE [TYPE]
.EE

Where FILE is a path with an extension, which sets the format (.vdi, .vmdk,
etc.), SIZE is a binary size such as "2.50G", and TYPE is an optional type
setting for either "fixed" or "dynamic".

.IP -C
Compact VDISK

This will attempt to compact the VDISK. If the VDISK is not of type dynamic,
the operation is canceled.

.SH OPTIONS

Some options may be added alongside OPERATION. Here is an example with
.OP -r

.EX
$ vvd -Ir /dev/sda
.EE

.IP -r
Open as raw

Open file, or device, as raw. This bypasses all format and header verifications.

.IP -c
Create as raw

Create file as raw. Only used in
.IR -N
, pre-allocates to SIZE.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B Get VDISK information

.EX
$ vvd -I windows10.vhd
.EE

.B Get disk information

Open as raw. Requires elevated privileges.

.EX
$ vvd -Ir /dev/sda
> vvd -Ir \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0
.EE

.B Create fixed VDISK

.EX
$ vvd -N arch.vdi 4G fixed
.EE

.SH WARNINGS

.B This tool is way too young to be called stable. This thing may explode violently.

This tool may likely change often during its growth.
